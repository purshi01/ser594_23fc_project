Description: The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assist potential homebuyers in determining the optimal time to purchase a house based on historical housing market data. We plan to analyze various factors such as housing prices, interest rates, economic indicators, and seasonal trends to identify patterns and correlations that can inform homebuying decisions. This project aims to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the real estate market and help individuals make informed choices when entering the housing market.

Intellectual Merit: This project has the potential to contribute new knowledge to the field of real estate and housing market analysis. By exploring and uncovering patterns in historical housing data, we aim to provide valuable insights that can aid homebuyers, real estate professionals, and policymakers in making data-driven decisions. The development of an accurate predictive model can empower individuals to make informed choices regarding one of the most significant investments in their lives.

Data Sourcing: To conduct this project, we will source housing data from reliable and up-to-date datasets, including sources like government housing reports, real estate market databases, and economic indicators from the year 2023 onwards. We will ensure that the data we use adheres to all necessary legal and ethical guidelines for data usage.

Background Knowledge:
To undertake this project successfully, a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and real estate economics is imperative. The following sources will serve as essential references to augment our understanding:

1. "Introduction to Machine Learning" by Alpaydin, Ethem.

   - This book provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning concepts, which will be crucial for building our predictive model.

2. "Real Estate Economics" by O'Sullivan, Arthur M. and Sexton, Terrence M.

   - This authoritative text will aid in developing a deep understanding of real estate market dynamics, ensuring the accuracy of our analysis.

3. "Data Science for Business" by Provost, Foster, and Fawcett, Tom.
   - This resource is invaluable for understanding how data science can be applied to real-world business problems, aligning with our project's practical objectives.

Related Work:
To enrich our project with existing research and insights, we will draw upon the following peer-reviewed academic papers:

1. "House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning" by Akhilendra Pratap Singh, Kartikey Rastogi, Shashank Rajpoot.

   - This paper explores the application of machine learning for house price prediction, providing valuable context for our predictive modeling efforts.

2. "Prediction of House Price Using Machine Learning Algorithms" by G Kiran Kumar, D Malathi Rani, Neeraja Koppula, Syed Ashraf.
   - This academic paper offers insights into the use of machine learning algorithms for predicting house prices, complementing our project's objectives.

By building on the foundation of these academic papers, we aim to contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of housing market analysis and prediction.

With a commitment to robust research, ethical data usage, and a focus on empowering individuals to make informed decisions in the real estate market, our project aspires to provide tangible benefits to both homeowners and industry professionals.
