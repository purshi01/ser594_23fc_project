Keywords: Housing Market, Property Investment Timing,Housing Price Prediction

Description:

The project's objective is to develop a predictive model utilizing historical housing market data to aid potential homebuyers in determining the optimal time to purchase a property. The model will analyze various factors, including property prices, interest rates, economic indicators, and seasonal variations. The goal is to identify patterns and correlations that can inform homebuying decisions, providing a deeper understanding of the real estate market's dynamics. This project serves to equip individuals with the knowledge to navigate the complexities of the housing market confidently.

Research Questions:

RO1: To describe the trends within historical housing data, this project will analyze price fluctuations, interest rate changes, and economic indicators, identifying patterns that could influence future market conditions.

RO2: To describe the trends within future housing market projections, this research aims to employ advanced predictive modeling techniques on historical data, striving for accurate forecasting of the housing price index in the upcoming months.

RO3: To describe the trends within our predictive model’s performance, this objective will employ rigorous validation and testing methods, ensuring the model’s accuracy, reliability, and consistency in delivering precise housing market forecasts.

RO4: To describe the trends within the underlying causal factors of the housing market, this research will conduct an in-depth analysis to understand how economic, social, and political factors collectively influence property prices.

Intellectual Merit:

This project's intellectual merit primarily lies in its potential to advance knowledge in real estate market analysis and predictive modeling. By analyzing historical housing data, including price fluctuations, interest rates, and economic indicators, we aim to uncover novel patterns and trends that can inform potential homebuyers and policymakers. The development and validation of a highly accurate and reliable predictive model will set new standards in real estate forecasting, ensuring users receive trustworthy guidance. Additionally, exploring the causal relationships within the housing market will deepen our understanding of the factors influencing property prices, contributing valuable insights to the field of data science and predictive analytics. Overall, this project is poised to enhance our knowledge of real estate market dynamics, supporting more informed decision-making.

Data Sourcing:

Our project will leverage specific, up-to-date datasets to ensure a robust analysis of the housing market. We will acquire mortgage interest rate data from the Federal Reserve’s "30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average in the U.S." dataset, accessible [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US). Additionally, the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset from Kaggle, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data), will provide comprehensive housing market data. We will also incorporate inflation rate figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s "Underlying Inflation Gauge (UIG) Full Data Set", available [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UIGFULL). All data, spanning from 2023 onwards, will be used in compliance with legal and ethical standards.

Background Knowledge:

To undertake this project successfully, a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and real estate economics is imperative. The following sources will serve as essential references to augment our understanding:

1. "Introduction to Machine Learning" by Alpaydin, Ethem.

   - This book provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning concepts, which will be crucial for building our predictive model.

2. "Real Estate Economics" by O'Sullivan, Arthur M. and Sexton, Terrence M.

   - This authoritative text will aid in developing a deep understanding of real estate market dynamics, ensuring the accuracy of our analysis.

3. "Data Science for Business" by Provost, Foster, and Fawcett, Tom.
   - This resource is invaluable for understanding how data science can be applied to real-world business problems, aligning with our project's practical objectives.
